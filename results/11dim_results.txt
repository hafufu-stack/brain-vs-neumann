11-Dimensional Brain Structure Simulation
========================================

Based on Blue Brain Project's discovery:
- Brain has structures up to 11 dimensions
- Dimension = clique size - 1
- 12 neurons fully connected = 11-dimensional simplex

Key findings:
- High-dimensional structures increase information capacity
- Pattern recognition improves with dimension
- 10-11 dimensions may be optimal for brain function
